Welcome to my Proxmox home lab adventure! In this blog post, I'll take you on a journey through my home lab setup powered by Proxmox Virtual Environment.

## Introduction

[Proxmox VE](https://www.proxmox.com/proxmox-ve) is an open-source virtualization platform that combines two powerful virtualization technologies: KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) for virtual machines and LXC (Linux Containers) for lightweight container-based virtualization. It allows me to run multiple virtual machines and containers on a single physical server, turning my home lab into a versatile playground for testing and development.

## The Hardware

Before diving into the virtual world, let's talk about the hardware. My Proxmox home lab is built on top of robust hardware, including:

- **Server**: Dell Poweredge R610 with ample CPU and RAM resources.
- **Storage**: High-capacity SSDs for speedy virtual machine storage.
- **Networking**: A gigabit switch and a reliable router for network management.

## Virtual Machines Galore

One of the most exciting aspects of Proxmox is the ability to create and manage virtual machines (VMs). I've set up various VMs for different purposes:

- **Web Server**: Hosting my personal website and web apps.
- **Development Environments**: Instantly spin up development environments for different projects.
- **Media Server**: Streaming movies and TV shows to my home devices.
- **Home Assistant**: Automating and controlling smart home devices.

## Container Magic with Docker and Portainer

In addition to VMs, I harness the power of Docker containers on Proxmox. Docker allows me to run applications and services in lightweight and isolated containers. For easy container management, I use [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io/), a user-friendly web interface.

- **Nextcloud**: My personal cloud storage solution, running in a Docker container.
- **Dockerized Apps**: Various applications and services running in containers for easy management via Portainer.

## NAS Backup and Data Redundancy

Data security and redundancy are critical in any home lab setup. To ensure the safety of my data, I implement automatic backups to my local disk and a Network-Attached Storage (NAS) system located in another location. This multi-layered backup strategy guarantees that my data is protected against unexpected disasters.

## Server Security

Keeping my Proxmox server secure is a top priority. I follow best practices like regularly updating software, using strong authentication methods, and configuring a robust firewall. Additionally, I monitor server activity and employ intrusion detection systems to safeguard against potential threats.

## Cloudflare Tunnels

To enhance the security and performance of my web services, I utilize [Cloudflare Tunnels](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps) to route traffic through Cloudflare's global network. This not only adds an extra layer of security but also improves the speed and reliability of my web applications.

## Conclusion

Exploring my Proxmox home lab has been an exciting journey. It provides me with the flexibility to experiment with new technologies, host services for personal use, and learn more about virtualization.

If you're interested in setting up your home lab or experimenting with virtualization, Proxmox is an excellent choice. Stay tuned for more tech adventures and home lab updates!

Happy virtualizing!
